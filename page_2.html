<h1>Vancouver's Cuisines</h1>

Vancouver is the home to many cultures and ethnicities. It comes as no surprise that the cuisines that have been developed here are heavily influenced by our ethnically diverse background. Bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean, Vancouver has established a reputation for delectable seafood and exquisite fine dining.
